# Homework 1: Tiny ImageNet

please copy the 02_bit.txt to the same folder with the code

## Implementation of classification models (40%)
1. KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) use KNeighborsClassifier
2. SVM (Support Vector Machine) use SVC
3. AlexNet use pytorch

## Implementation and justification of feature extraction methods (40%)
1. color histogram
2. HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
3. SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) with k-means clustering

## Quality and depth of the experimental analysis (10%)
compare the performance of the different methods

## Clarity and thoroughness of the report (10%)
Please read the Report in pdf

## Note
1. if you want to run the code, please download the Tiny ImageNet dataset first:
2. if you want to run the code faster, you can try to reduce classes of the dataset. use (02_bit.txt)
3. if you want to run the code faster, you can only use one load data in the beginning of the code.(remove load data behind every method)
