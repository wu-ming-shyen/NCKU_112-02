# Image Classification with MobileNetV3, ResNet34, and GhostNet

This repository contains the implementation of training and evaluating image classification models using MobileNetV3, ResNet34, and GhostNet architectures. The models are trained on a dataset, validated, and then evaluated on a test set. The training, validation, and evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
